Introduction and Purpose
- This script provisions a host to be used for pentesting labs and CTF games, such as HackTheBox and VulnHub. It consists of tools and configurations that I have consistently used and many extras that others may find useful for various situations. It is especially useful if you require persistence and/or prefer to use a remote host, such as an AWS instance, rather than a local VM.

Installation
1. Create an Ubuntu 18.04 or 19.04 host
2. Place install.sh in the /home/$USER folder
3. chmod +x install.sh
4. Run with ./install.sh (do not run as root or sudo)

Notes
- Only tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 19.04 (server and desktop)
- After installation, run scripts in /recon as root
